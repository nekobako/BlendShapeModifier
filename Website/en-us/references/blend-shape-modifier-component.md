# `Blend Shape Modifier` Component
The only component in this tool.  
Here, you can set the target renderer and add or remove shapes.

You can also toggle the real-time preview.  
Because the current preview process is performance-heavy, it is recommended to enable it only when checking the blend shapes you have created.
