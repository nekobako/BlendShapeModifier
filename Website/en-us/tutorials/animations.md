4. Change the `Weight` value of the blend shape you want to animate.  
Switching `Preview` to `Enable` makes it easier to see the actual movement.

6. Use [Gesture Manager](https://github.com/BlackStartx/VRC-Gesture-Manager) or [Av3 Emulator](https://github.com/lyuma/Av3Emulator) to confirm that the animation works as expected.
